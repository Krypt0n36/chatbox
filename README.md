End-to-end, real-time, plug-and-play


Chatbox is a combination of cryptographic methods that enables clients to inter-communicate via a broadcasting server and without revealing any unencrypted/plain text data.

Chatbox heavily relies on cryptography to avoid central trust.

. Hashing algorithms SHA256.
. Asymetric(Public key / Private key) cryptography AES256.
. Digital signature (Json Web Tokens).
. RSA key exchange.

With all these techniques combined, its possible to reach maximum anonymity when exchanging messages with another client even tho the server is the middleman.

Trust cryptography not centralisation.
